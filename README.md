I have created a small project in Gemini (Pro) 🤖 to support me in managing my diabetes. It has started as an "Agent", a GEM, dedicated to help me in reading and using the data from my CGM.
After than less than 24 hours, I can confirm that is a valid support to manage many aspects of diabetes as well as managing sport activities associated 🏋️, meals 🍝 and insuline intake 💉.
I can namely add some additional objectives I can add to the Agent setup, even though the current version looks very flexlible already ✅.
The agent is set up in italian 🇮🇹.

Utilization: ⚙️
- The agent expects to receive regular data from your CGM, for example pasting the print screen of your mobile 📱, and it comments the situation.
- It is advised to start the first conversations with some general information about you (doses of insulin per day, therapy, lifestyle, ...) and then continue with the use / questions 🧑‍⚕️.
- The agent can support in decide on how many units of insuline to do for each meal (it seems quite conservative, which is good at this stage).
- If asked, it can also "estimate" the CHO in each meal by pasting a picture of your plate / meal 🍽️📸 (here probably it can improve, the estimation phase, while the food recognition was very impressive).
- It is advised to keep to converse in the same chat so that the Agent remembers what it has been said before 🧠.

Next steps: 🚀
- Clearly state the objectives to such as reduce ipoglicemies 📉, improve TBR 📈, etc.
- Use Time in Range data to check the correct direction of the strategies ✅.
- Have some sort of backup? or report to discuss with the real doctors?👨‍⚕️
