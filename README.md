I have created a small project in Gemini to support me in managing my diabetes. It has started as an "Agent", a GEM, dedicated to help me in reading and using the data from my CGM. 
After than less than 24 hours, I can confirm that is a valid support to manage many aspects of Diabetes. I can namely add some additional objectives I can add to the Agent setup, even though the current version looks very flexlible already.
